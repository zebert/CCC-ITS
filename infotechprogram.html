									<img id="testimonialimg" src="images/testimonials/pc.png" alt="Peggy Chessmore" height=110 width=100>
									<strong>Peggy Chessmore – Instructional Technology Support</strong>
										<p>
										Peggy Chessmore graduated in May 2000 with an Associate Degree in Information 
										Technology, specializing as an Integrated Application Systems Specialist. She went 
										on to receive her Bachelors and Master Degrees from Belleview University in Business 
										Information Systems and Leadership, respectively. </p>
										<p>
										Starting in January of 2000 she starting working with the newly forming online courses 
										in the Learning Support Services (LSS) office on the Hastings Campus of Central Community 
										College.  Peggy is starting her 18th year of working in the LSS office as an Instructional 
										Technology Specialist.</p>

									<img id="testimonialimg" src="images/testimonials/austin.jpg" alt="Austin Shaw" height=115 width=100>
									<strong>Austin Shaw – Systems Analyst</strong>
										<p>
										Austin Shaw received his Associate Degree in Information Technology – Developer and is a 
										Systems Analyst for Mid-America Computer Corporation. He develops a desktop application for 
										telephone companies that manages over 750,000 customers. The application also turns on phone 
										and internet lines, and sends out their bills. He works with a team of 6 other developers. The 
										application is coded in Delphi (which is similar to C#) and connects to a SQL Server Database. 
										They also have a web app that connects to the same database as the desktop app, but with limited 
										functionality. The web app is coded in C# and uses MVC software architecture. What he does on a 
										daily basis is develop new functionality for their software, as well as analyze and design solutions 
										for proposed changes. He also tracks down and repairs defects, and researches new technologies that 
										will benefit their customers and integrates those upgrades into the existing software.</p>

									<img id="testimonialimg" src="images/testimonials/simeon_portrait_med.jpg" alt="Simeon Berns" height=105 width=105>
									<strong>Simeon Berns – Business Owner</strong>
										<p>
										I graduated the IT program at CCC in 2009. After graduating I worked at Hastings Utilities for almost 
										5 years. During that time, I continued to progress and develop, using the skills I learned at CCC. In 2014 
										I took a job at Xpanxion in Kearney, NE, where I worked with a team at Sony, building automated tests for 
										one of their internal web applications. A couple years later, in 2016, I started my own software development 
										consultancy and have been doing that ever since. These days I primarily work with Ruby on Rails, EmberJS and 
										Cucumber.</p>
										<p>
										I think the most important thing I learned at CCC was how to think critically and problem solve. In my 
										experience in the IT field (specifically software development), that is one of the most important skills to 
										possess. You can learn a new language or tool by watching YouTube or just simple trial and error. But if you 
										can’t solve problems and debug properly, then the new languages aren’t that useful.</p>
										<br/>
										
									<img id="testimonialimg" src="images/testimonials/joe.jpg" alt="Joe McMinamen" height=115 width=100>
									<strong>Joe McMinamen – Technology Director</strong>
										<p>
										I graduated from CCC IT program in 2008. After graduation I continued my education at Wayne State College 
										while also working as an intern for ConAgra Foods in Omaha. I graduated from Wayne State in 2010 with a Bachelor 
										degree in Computer Information Systems. My internship moved to full time employment and I continued with ConAgra 
										Foods for 5 more years. I am currently the Technology Director for the West Harrison Community School in Mondamin, IA. 
										Here I am in charge of all IT aspects from our 1 to 1 program down to networking and wireless technologies. </p>
										<p>
										The most important thing I learned at CCC was how to solve difficult problems using the tools and people around you. 
										Learning to network with other students and IT professionals can help you to accomplish many tasks. The instructors are 
										very supportive of their students and help give them the skills they will continue to use throughout their professional 
										lives.</p>

									<img id="testimonialimg" src="images/testimonials/dustin.jpg" alt="Dustin Johnson" height=110 width=100>
									<strong>Dustin Johnson – IT Administrator</strong>
										<p>
										I was a student at CCC Hastings from 1998 to 2000.  It was a great place to learn and prep for future endeavors. The 
										instructors were always easy to talk to and always willing to help. I took computer hardware and language base classes 
										during my time there. </p>
										<p>
										After I graduated I went on to work for AxtellTech a small wireless ISP. Then in 2001 I jointed Platte Valley 
										Communications as a Computer Technician and later becoming the IT Administrator, managing a team of IT and Security Technicians. 
										We manage small business IT infrastructure; everything from running bulk cabling to server administration. We also install a full 
										array of Access Control, Surveillance, and Security Systems. These days the line in between IT and Security is pretty thin. </p>
										<br/>
									
									<img id="testimonialimg" src="images/testimonials/devin1.jpg" alt="Devin Burch" height=110 width=105>
									<strong>Devin Burch - Current Student</strong>
										<p>
										CCC has given me the opportunity to reinvent myself and my future. In the nearly two years I've spent working towards a degree in 
										Information Technology and Systems Development, I've learned so much and grown as a both a student and a soon-to-be software developer. 
										The affordable program allowed me to focus on my education rather than worrying about how I would support myself while paying for college. 
										Thanks to the dedication of the instructors and staff at CCC, I feel ready to move on to a great paying job in a field I've grown to love. 
										What more could you ask for?</p>
