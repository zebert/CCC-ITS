								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p> The Business Technology program provides the 
									skills and knowledge necessary to prepare students 
									for careers as administrative support professionals 
									in today's modern office workplace. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The role of the Business Technology professional continues 
									to evolve as technology advances and expectations now encompass 
									a wide range of skills and responsibilities. These duties may 
									include providing training and orientation to new staff, 
									supporting all aspects of management, conducting research, 
									and learning and operating new technologies and software.
								</p>
								<p>
									Today's business professional serves as an information 
									clearinghouse; manages projects, meetings and schedules; 
									organizes and maintains paper and electronic records; and 
									produces a wide array of written and oral communications. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Technology skills are essential in this career, including 
									the utilization of software such as: word processing, spreadsheets, 
									databases, presentations, desktop publishing, project management, 
									webpage support, and graphics programs. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Business Technology graduates are prepared to:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Provide high level administrative support by conducting 
									research, preparing statistical reports, and handling information 
									requests.</li>
									<li>Perform support functions related to preparing correspondence, 
									customer service, scheduling, data entry, organizing and prioritizing.</li>
									<li>Apply business software programs at a specialist level.</li>
									<li>Utilize emerging physical and virtual technologies in the workplace.</li>
									<li>Demonstrate communication, collaboration, ethical, legal, and 
									critical thinking skills.</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Careers</h3>
								<p>
									Constantly evolving technologies allow for lifelong learning and 
									continued professional development and advancement. According 
									to O-Net Online, a partner with jobcenter.usa.gov, office and 
									administrative support positions are categorized as a "bright 
									outlook" occupation. These job opportunities are expected to 
									grow rapidly in the next several years with large numbers of 
									job openings and new and emerging responsibilities.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Job titles include:</strong> <br />
									Administrative Assistant, Administrative Supervisor, 
									Administrative Technician, Clerk Typist, Customer Service Manager,

									Executive Assistant, Human Resources Coordinator, 
									Information Clerk, Legal Assistant, Medical Office Assistant, 
									Office Assistant, Office Coordinator, Office Manager, 
									Project Coordinator, Receptionist, Sales Support Specialist, 
									Software Specialist and Team Leader.
								</p>
								<p>
									According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of 
									office and administrative support occupations is projected to 
									show little or no change from 2016 to 2026. Technology is 
									expected to substitute or supplant some functions that 
									workers in office and administrative support occupations do.
								</p>
								<p>
									The median annual wage for office and administrative 
									support occupations was $34,050 in May 2016, below 
									the median for all occupations of $37,040 (Bureau 
									of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, 
									2017-2018 Occupational Outlook Handbook).
